# An-MSA-Shopping-Mall-Project-Implemented-with-IaC
## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on building an EKS cluster using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and implementing a shopping mall application based on a microservices architecture (MSA).

### Key Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
  Utilized **Terragrunt** to ensure reusability and maintainability of infrastructure configurations.

- **Kubernetes**  
  Leveraged **Amazon EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for scalability and efficient container orchestration.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**  
  Integrated **GitHub Actions** and **Argo CD** to implement a robust continuous integration and deployment process.

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**  
  Deployed **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor and visualize the health of the infrastructure.

- **Application Monitoring**  
  Implemented **Datadog** for detailed monitoring and performance insights of the application.
